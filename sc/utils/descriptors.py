class AngularFourierSeries(BaseFeaturizer):
    """
    Compute the angular Fourier series (AFS), including both angular and radial info
    The AFS is the product of pairwise distance function (g_n, g_n') between two pairs
    of atoms (sharing the common central site) and the cosine of the angle
    between the two pairs. The AFS is a 2-dimensional feature (the axes are g_n,
    g_n').
    Examples of distance functionals are square functions, Gaussian, trig
    functions, and Bessel functions. An example for Gaussian:
        lambda d: exp( -(d - d_n)**2 ), where d_n is the coefficient for g_n
    See :func:`~matminer.featurizers.utils.grdf` for a full list of available binning functions.
    There are two preset conditions:
        gaussian: bin functions are gaussians
        histogram: bin functions are rectangular functions
    Features:
        AFS ([gn], [gn']) - Angular Fourier Series between binning functions (g1 and g2)
    Args:
        bins:   ([AbstractPairwise]) a list of binning functions that
                implement the AbstractPairwise base class
        cutoff: (float) maximum distance to look for neighbors. The
                 featurizer will run slowly for large distance cutoffs
                 because of the number of neighbor pairs scales as
                 the square of the number of neighbors
